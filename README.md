## What is Snard Token?

**Snard Token ($SNARD)** is a utility token on the Solana blockchain that supports the Garlip.com platform —a tool for copyrighting creative works via blockchain-stamped certificates.

Snard blends coin culture with real-world utility by giving creators incentives and tools to protect their intellectual property in a decentralized, timestamped, and verifiable way. With 1 billion tokens minted, $SNARD is designed to reward early adopters, power platform interactions, and evolve into a community-governed asset.

## Garlip.com Overview

Garlip is a platform where users can:

- Upload creative works (art, writing, music, etc.)
- Generate a blockchain certificate of authorship
- Get timestamped proof of creation
- Include metadata such as copyright holder, date, and description
- Share certificates using QR codes linking to on-chain records

In the near future, Garlip will integrate AI tools to help determine whether a submission is likely to be copyrightable, streamlining and validating the process.

Snard will be opening to whdigo.com and other productivity tools in the near future.
